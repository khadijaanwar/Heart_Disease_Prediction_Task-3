# Heart Disease Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the presence of heart disease based on clinical parameters. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 🚀 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Preprocessing & Feature Encoding
- Model Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Performance Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC)
- Visualizations of Prediction Results

## 🧠 Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Seaborn, Matplotlib

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset can be found on [Kaggle – Heart Disease UCI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ronitf/heart-disease-uci).

Save the dataset in the `data/` directory.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khadijaanwar/Heart_Disease_Prediction_Task-3
cd heart-disease-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb
```

## 📊 Example Output

- Confusion matrix
- ROC curve
- Feature importance graphs
